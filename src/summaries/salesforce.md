### 15 Aug 2025 – Tech-Savvy and Sales-Smart: Two Generations of Agentforce Account Executives
[Read more](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentforce-account-executive-interview/)

Agentforce is reshaping work by automating tasks like case triaging, record queries, and customer engagement, but measuring actual time saved by agents is complex because human workflows are rarely straightforward. Salesforce’s Research & Insights team studied over 2,700 sellers to evaluate agent value, creating a framework based on task complexity, action maturity, and frequency to realistically assess return on investment (ROI). They found that agents provide the greatest benefits on frequent, effortful tasks, while highly complex tasks still require human judgment and simpler tasks may yield limited impact unless part of scalable patterns. Applying the framework involves assessing task steps, dependencies, data needs, and human judgment to gauge complexity, then reviewing current automated capabilities, reliability, data integration, and frequency to estimate ROI. Ultimately, designing agents with intention—grounded in understanding real work—enables meaningful time savings that let humans focus on higher-value activities driving business growth and innovation.

### 15 Aug 2025 – Should You Automate This? How to Choose the Right Workflows for AI Agents
[Read more](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentic-automation/)

User experience (UX) design is undergoing its most profound transformation since the internet’s emergence, shifting from static interfaces with predictable user journeys to dynamic, intent-centric agentic experiences where multiple AI agents coordinate across platforms in real time. Traditional UX principles no longer suffice as designers must now envision and build intelligent, orchestrated systems that adapt to user intent and agent capabilities, leveraging tools like Cursor AI and MCP protocols to prototype and test multi-agent workflows. This evolution transforms designers’ roles from interface architects to experience orchestrators and system builders, requiring mastery of AI-assisted development, cross-platform coordination, and real system testing. Emerging patterns such as unified agent status indicators, permission choreography, and platform-agnostic action panels enhance flexibility and user understanding, enabling faster innovation and richer ecosystem integration. Designers who embrace this future by learning new tools, experimenting with protocols, and building real prototypes will lead the next era of human-AI interaction, crafting seamless, coordinated experiences that preserve human agency.

### 15 Aug 2025 – 3 Ways to Responsibly Manage Multi-Agent Systems
[Read more](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/responsibly-manage-multi-agent-systems/)

AI agents are revolutionizing business operations by automating workflows and enhancing user experiences but pose significant security risks without a solid framework. Salesforce’s Agentforce provides a structured approach to securely deploying autonomous AI agents across enterprises, focusing on five foundational security attributes: clearly defining the agent’s role to limit scope and access; enforcing strict data governance and minimization to protect sensitive information; tightly controlling actions, distinguishing between public and private tasks with appropriate verification; implementing dynamic guardrails using supervisory models, security layers, and precise instructions to prevent misuse; and securing deployment channels with robust endpoint protection and standard security protocols. By integrating these principles from the start, organizations can confidently deploy AI agents that operate safely, reliably, and within compliance, while maintaining trust and control—laying a strong foundation for scalable, secure AI-driven business functions.

The Salesforce Insiders Program offers interview candidates a unique opportunity to connect with current employees—called Insiders—who volunteer to share authentic insights about Salesforce’s culture, benefits, and work environment outside of the formal hiring process. This casual, candid conversation helps candidates ask questions about daily life, career development, and community involvement to feel confident that Salesforce is the right fit. With over 300 Insiders from diverse roles and backgrounds worldwide, the program fosters genuine connections, often continuing beyond the interview, as exemplified by candidates who have formed lasting relationships with their Insiders.

### 15 Aug 2025 – How IBM and Salesforce are Using Zero Copy to Reshape Enterprise AI
[Read more](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/salesforce-ibm-zero-copy-partnership/)

Time series forecasting is vital for data-driven decision making but often demands custom engineering across domains and resolutions, raising costs especially in large enterprises. To address this, the universal forecasting paradigm began with Moirai 1.1, an open-source foundation model, and the GIFT-Eval leaderboard, which now hosts 27 models including 14 foundation models from industry and academia. Building on this, Moirai 2.0 offers a faster, more accurate time series foundation model that ranks #1 on GIFT-Eval (excluding test data-leaking models). Key improvements include moving from a masked encoder to a decoder-only transformer architecture, expanding pretraining datasets with diverse sources (including synthetic and internal data), and refining training with quantile loss, multi-token prediction, data filtering, and enhanced embeddings for robustness. Moirai 2.0 outperforms its predecessor Moirai_large by 16% on MASE, 13% on CRPS, is 44% faster at inference, and 96% smaller, making it a more efficient and scalable forecasting solution. A simple code example demonstrates how to load the model, generate forecasts, and visualize results on the electricity dataset, facilitating easy adoption by practitioners.

Last year, Salesforce retired the Well-Architected program, but strong community feedback made it clear this was a mistake. In response, Salesforce has been revamping the program to better meet real-world needs by re-evaluating its content, format, and engagement model, with a focus on actionable guidance and collaboration with users. The program will officially relaunch at Dreamforce 2025, reflecting the growing complexity of the platform and renewed commitment to supporting a vibrant architect community through events, advocacy, and ongoing feedback opportunities. Salesforce is eager to rebuild the program alongside its community and looks forward to sharing updates at Dreamforce.

### 14 Aug 2025 – What Is Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Marketing?
[Read more](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-is-pay-per-click-ppc/)

SEO is a vital, long-term strategy for startups aiming to grow their online presence by improving website visibility in search engine results. Although SEO takes time and consistent effort, it attracts highly relevant traffic, builds lasting value beyond paid ads, and adapts to changing market trends. Startups should avoid common myths like focusing only on high-volume keywords, treating SEO as dead, or expecting content to rank automatically without ongoing optimization. Effective SEO involves setting clear, measurable goals aligned with business outcomes, researching intent-driven keywords with manageable competition, and creating high-quality, user-focused content. Building quality backlinks, optimizing on-page elements (such as site structure, title tags, and mobile-friendliness), and fixing technical issues are crucial to enhance rankings. Off-page activities like social media engagement and local SEO also support visibility and traffic growth. Regularly reviewing and updating SEO efforts ensures sustained performance. With modest weekly time investment and practical steps, startups can become SEO-ready quickly and benefit from consistent organic growth alongside complementary marketing tools like Salesforce CRM.
