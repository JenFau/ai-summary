## What the paper claims
Generative AI is moving from experimentation to enterprise-scale deployment, demanding a rethink of system design, governance, cost management, and workforce capabilities. Success will depend on strategic investment in architectures and processes that enable adaptability, compliance, and innovation at scale.

## Methods or approach
The paper distils insights from conversations with Fortune 500 tech leaders and synthesises practical strategies for AI adoption. It examines architectural principles, model selection tactics, governance frameworks, and developer enablement trends, referencing industry tools and standards.

## Key findings
- AI systems require dynamic architectures with always-on infrastructure, intelligent data ingestion, and AI-optimised knowledge layers.
- Cost management hinges on model specialisation, hybrid/on-prem deployments, and model composition with feedback-driven fine-tuning.
- Governance needs to address AI-specific risks via platforms like WatsonX and IBM Manta, alongside emerging interface standards MCP and A2A.

## Limitations and caveats
- Focuses on large enterprises; smaller organisations may face different constraints.
- Provides strategic direction but lacks detailed quantitative benchmarks or case studies.

## Implications for practitioners
- Invest early in adaptive, feedback-driven architectures to avoid stagnation in AI initiatives.
- Select and combine models strategically to balance performance and cost while preparing for evolving workloads.
- Embrace governance and interoperability standards to enable scalable, compliant AI operations.
