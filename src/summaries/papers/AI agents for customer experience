## What the paper claims
The report contends that “agentic” AI—LLM-powered systems that can plan, take action and coordinate across back-end workflows—can transform customer experience from reactive, scripted interactions to proactive, end-to-end resolution. It urges organisations to focus AI on creating delightful CX outcomes rather than narrow automation or cost reduction.

## Methods or approach
This is an analyst perspective that synthesises market observations, a three-stage AI maturity model (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced), and a poll of CX leaders used illustratively (including a headline statistic on self-assessed maturity). It provides scenario narratives contrasting traditional vs agentic AI, and prescriptive guidance for sequencing use cases.

## Key findings
- Most organisations remain at a “Beginner” maturity, relying on legacy IVR, scripted chatbots, and limited integrations; a cited poll reports 63% self-placing at this level.
- Agentic AI differs by orchestrating multi-step actions (e.g., updating self-service, sending proactive updates, monitoring outcomes) rather than merely surfacing insights.
- Well-designed GenAI self-service can become customers’ preferred entry point when it preserves context, solves problems directly, and hands off seamlessly to humans when needed.

## Limitations and caveats
- The report is conceptual and persuasive; it does not detail sampling, methodology, or quantitative results beyond a brief poll reference.
- It includes links to vendor resources, so recommendations may align with capabilities typical of that ecosystem.

## Implications for practitioners
- Start with high-friction tasks (e.g., call summarisation, knowledge retrieval), measure impact, and expand to orchestration across CRM/ERP once foundations and data access are in place.
- Shift success metrics from containment and handle time to customer effort, proactive resolution, and quality of human–AI collaboration.
