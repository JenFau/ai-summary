## What the paper claims
Generative AI can transform industries but requires a robust, flexible foundation to manage complexity, ensure security, and maintain compliance. Success depends on combining the right tools, infrastructure, governance, and expertise with a collaborative, open ecosystem.

## Methods or approach
The guide synthesises IDC and Kearney research with Red Hat’s own platform experience. It presents seven considerations—ranging from development toolsets to platform expertise—illustrated with emerging practices such as retrieval-augmented generation, prompt tuning, CI/CD for AI, and containerised deployments.

## Key findings
- Preintegrated, open toolsets accelerate generative AI application development and deployment.
- Hybrid cloud infrastructure supports fine-tuning, secure model serving, and compliance with data locality requirements.
- Lifecycle automation via CI/CD and GitOps improves speed and consistency.
- Continuous monitoring for bias, drift, and anomalies is essential for model governance.
- Partner ecosystems and expert guidance help reduce integration friction and deployment risk.

## Limitations and caveats
- Vendor-produced content; recommendations align with Red Hat OpenShift AI and partner offerings.
- Lacks quantitative benchmarks on cost, performance, or risk reduction.

## Implications for practitioners
- Select platforms that integrate development, fine-tuning, serving, monitoring, and governance in one environment.
- Build governance into workflows early, including explainability, security, and bias mitigation.
- Use hybrid cloud and containerisation to ensure scalability, portability, and compliance.
- Leverage partners and platform experts for faster, more reliable adoption.
