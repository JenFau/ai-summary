  This Forrester report argues that successful workforce AI adoption depends less on technology itself and more on embedding AI into a human-centred culture. It outlines risks of neglecting employee readiness, offers strategies to frame AI as an opportunity builder, and details cultural levers for sustainable adoption.

## What the paper claims
AI strategies that focus primarily on data and technology risk failure if they overlook the human experience. Employees’ skills, trust, and engagement are critical to adoption, and cultural integration of AI is essential to realise productivity and business benefits.

## Methods or approach
The report draws on survey data, interviews with industry leaders, and real-world deployment examples to analyse adoption challenges and present a framework for human-centric AI strategy. It applies Forrester’s organisational culture model—shared purpose, behavioural norms, rituals, and artifacts—to workforce AI integration.

## Key findings
- Most AI augments rather than replaces humans, making employee readiness and buy-in critical to success.
- Overreliance on AI can reduce critical thinking skills, lead to “good enough” satisficing, and heighten employee fears.
- Framing AI as an “opportunity builder” improves adoption, linking tools to career growth, skill development, and problem-solving.
- Embedding AI into organisational culture through shared purpose, behavioural norms, recurring rituals, and visible artifacts sustains positive adoption behaviours.

## Limitations and caveats
- Recommendations are based on case studies and expert opinion rather than controlled empirical trials.
- The cultural approach requires sustained leadership commitment and may be challenging in fragmented or low-trust organisations.

## Implications for practitioners
- Design AI rollouts to involve employees directly in shaping workflows and tools, reinforcing shared ownership.
- Invest in ongoing behavioural change support, peer learning, and tailored resources to maintain adoption momentum.
- Use storytelling and visible successes to counter scepticism and link AI use to personal and organisational wins.
