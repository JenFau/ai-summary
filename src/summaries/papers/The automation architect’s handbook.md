## What the paper claims
The handbook positions the automation architect as central to achieving strategic, organisation-wide automation. It argues that success depends on aligning automation with business priorities, uniting teams and processes, creating governance structures, and adopting platforms and practices that scale across domains.

## Methods or approach
The guide combines Red Hat’s consulting insights, survey statistics from Harvard Business Review, and Forrester’s automation maturity framework. It presents a staged journey—from initial assessment to advanced capabilities—offering checklists, example workflows, and cultural change strategies.

## Key findings
- 80% of executives view IT automation as “extremely important” to future success, but many lack unified strategies.
- Effective automation requires assessing maturity, setting realistic goals, optimising processes before automating, and starting small.
- Governance, centralised content repositories, and training are essential for scaling safely.
- Advanced capabilities such as event-driven automation, generative AI-assisted code creation, and edge automation expand value.

## Limitations and caveats
- The report is vendor-authored and aligns with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform’s capabilities.
- While practical, examples are illustrative rather than quantitative performance data.

## Implications for practitioners
- Use structured maturity assessments to identify gaps and prioritise initiatives.
- Build a central automation repository, establish governance early, and invest in community-of-practice training.
- Start with simple, high-value use cases, then iterate toward more complex, cross-domain processes.
- Leverage emerging capabilities like event-driven automation and AI-assisted content creation to accelerate adoption.
