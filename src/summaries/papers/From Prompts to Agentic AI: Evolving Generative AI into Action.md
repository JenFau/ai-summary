summary: |
  This Forrester report outlines the shift from prompt-driven generative AI to autonomous, adaptive "agentic AI" systems capable of planning, acting, and collaborating with minimal human oversight. It describes key design patterns, current capabilities, and early enterprise use cases, while highlighting technical, ethical, and integration challenges.

## What the paper claims
Agentic AI marks a new stage in generative AI’s development, moving from language-based interaction to systems that can independently set goals, make decisions, and execute complex workflows. By embedding autonomy and adaptability into AI applications, organisations can unlock more powerful, real-world use cases.

## Methods or approach
The report uses a conceptual framework describing generative AI’s evolution in three stages — prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic systems — supplemented with design patterns (reflection, memory, planning, tool use, multiagent collaboration, and autonomy). It draws on examples from industry, performance benchmarks, and interviews with enterprise technology leaders.

## Key findings
- Agentic AI systems outperform basic prompt-based LLM strategies in complex tasks by combining planning, memory, tool integration, and autonomous execution.
- Six core design patterns underpin agentic AI: reflection, memory, planning, tool use, multiagent collaboration, and autonomy.
- Early enterprise adoption is emerging in sectors like pharmaceuticals, with frameworks such as AutoGen and LangChain enabling multiagent workflows.

## Limitations and caveats
- Agentic AI remains in an early, experimental phase; many design concepts are not yet reliable for production use.
- Vendor hype and loose definitions risk confusion, misaligned expectations, and poor implementation choices.

## Implications for practitioners
- Integrate agentic AI into a broader automation strategy to avoid fragmented processes and ensure cohesion.
- Apply strong governance, security controls, and bias mitigation to protect data and maintain trust in agent-led workflows.
