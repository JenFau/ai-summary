  Aragon Research outlines how AI-powered Copilots—intelligent assistants combining conversational and generative AI—are set to transform contact centre operations. Unlike traditional virtual agents, Copilots coach and guide human agents and supervisors in real time, improving resolution speed, onboarding, and customer experience.

## What the paper claims
Copilots represent the next generation of intelligent assistants in contact centres, surpassing the capabilities of virtual agents by providing real-time, personalised guidance and coaching to agents and supervisors. This integration of conversational and generative AI will improve efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction.

## Methods or approach
The note synthesises market observations, technology capabilities, and industry case examples (e.g. NICE’s Enlighten Copilot) to differentiate Copilots from virtual agents and outline their potential applications. It also provides strategic recommendations for piloting and deployment.

## Key findings
- Copilots combine conversational and generative AI to deliver real-time support and feedback to agents and supervisors.
- They excel in onboarding, coaching, and assisting with complex customer interactions.
- Unlike virtual agents, Copilots can manage nuanced conversations, ask clarifying questions, and provide industry-specific guidance.
- Adoption will benefit sectors like banking, healthcare, telecoms, government, and insurance.
- Piloting in targeted use cases is recommended before broad deployment.

## Limitations and caveats
- Technology is emerging; full ROI and operational impacts are not yet well-documented.
- Effectiveness depends on integration with existing contact centre systems and data sources.

## Implications for practitioners
- Evaluate existing contact centre providers for Copilot capabilities or roadmaps.
- Start with pilot deployments in one or two high-impact areas.
- Invest in prompt engineering skills and AI governance to ensure optimal performance and compliance.
