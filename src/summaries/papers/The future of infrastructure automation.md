summary: |
  Forrester outlines how infrastructure automation must evolve from today’s unintelligent, siloed, and underfunded state into a smart, consolidated, and confident discipline. AI, infrastructure as code, and better knowledge management are central to delivering predictive, cross-domain automation that scales with business needs.

## What the paper claims
The report argues that current infrastructure automation tools are limited by a lack of intelligence, siloed operations, and underinvestment. To meet the demands of modern IT, automation must be AI-driven, unified across domains, and trusted to autonomously manage complex, dynamic scenarios.

## Methods or approach
The analysis synthesises findings from Forrester’s research, including the 2023 Infrastructure Hardware Survey, and market examples. It proposes a “smart, consolidated, confident” framework, illustrates vendor progress, and examines how AI, IaC, and centres of excellence can accelerate maturity.

## Key findings
- Most automation remains static, tool-specific, and underfunded, with few organisations having a dedicated automation COE.
- AI will enable self-recognising automation, continuous optimisation, and predictive problem resolution.
- Infrastructure as code will underpin tool consolidation, cross-domain standardisation, and scaling.
- Knowledge management, especially with LLMs, will become critical to feeding and improving automation systems.

## Limitations and caveats
- The report is primarily conceptual and strategic; it does not include quantitative performance benchmarks for the proposed approaches.
- Some examples are vendor-linked and may align with specific commercial offerings.

## Implications for practitioners
- Invest in AI-enabled automation to move from reactive, domain-limited scripts to proactive, cross-domain orchestration.
- Build or strengthen automation COEs to align tooling, governance, and skill development.
- Integrate knowledge management into automation design to ensure continuous improvement.
- Use IaC to standardise processes and enable portability between on-premises and cloud environments.
