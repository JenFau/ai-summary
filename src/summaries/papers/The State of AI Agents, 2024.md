## What the paper claims
AI agents—autonomous systems capable of understanding context, making decisions, and executing actions—represent a significant advancement in AI, with near-term business benefits and longer-term consumer potential. Adoption will be shaped by technological maturity, regulatory environments, and organisational readiness.

## Methods or approach
The authors synthesise market observations, industry surveys, and Forrester’s own research to map AI agent maturity, identify five core use cases, assess adoption readiness across industries, and propose a structured approach for implementation and risk management.

## Key findings
- Businesses are more eager and prepared for AI agents than consumers, with higher budgets and investment plans.
- The market is fragmented, with few integrated, end-to-end AI agent solutions.
- Current automation implementation practices are insufficient for AI agents’ complexity.
- Regulatory, ethical, and security concerns are major adoption barriers.
- Financial services and healthcare are poised to be early adopters due to decision complexity and potential benefits.

## Limitations and caveats
- Consumer adoption is hindered by low awareness and trust in AI.
- Benefit timelines vary widely by use case, with some not viable in the near term.

## Implications for practitioners
- Clearly define AI agent use cases, autonomy levels, and guardrails before deployment.
- Prepare employees for role changes from routine tasks to strategic functions.
- Demand strong production observability and real-time monitoring from vendors.
- Apply an “align by design” governance approach to manage risks and ensure compliance with organisational values.
