## Summary

The central thesis is that Apple's DNA, cultivated by Steve Jobs, is uniquely unsuited to the age of AI and may lead to the company's decline.

**Key points:**
*   **Steve Jobs's Vision:** Jobs believed in controlling the entire computing experience to liberate users from complexity, focusing on polished, perfected products developed in secret.
*   **Apple's DNA:** Apple obsesses over perfecting experiences in secret, and engineers rarely leave.
*   **AI is Messy:** The age of AI is probabilistic and unpredictable, which contrasts with Apple's deterministic approach.
*   **Early AI Adoption:** AI is obviously useful, unlike early computers, and doesn't require a perfect interface for adoption.
*   **Apple's Strategy:** Apple is building an AI device, but AI is evolving rapidly and Apple's device risks being outdated.
*   **Multimodel World:** The AI landscape is becoming multimodel, with users leveraging multiple AI models, which clashes with Apple's walled garden approach.
*   **Siri's Failure:** Siri is not keeping pace with advancements in AI-driven voice experiences.
*   **Risk of Irrelevance:** Apple risks becoming irrelevant by prioritizing polish over rapid iteration and adoption of AI technologies.

**Call to Action:**
*   Apple needs to shift its culture to embrace messiness, ship products faster, and adopt an AI-first mindset to remain competitive in the age of AI.
